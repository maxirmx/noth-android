# Noth Android 

[Download the APK from here](https://github.com/maxirmx/noth-android/releases/latest)

## Summary

Noth integrates directly with [Oxen Service Nodes](https://docs.oxen.io/about-the-oxen-blockchain/oxen-service-nodes), which are a set of distributed, decentralized and Sybil resistant nodes. Service Nodes act as servers which store messages offline, and a set of nodes which allow for onion routing functionality obfuscating users' IP addresses. For a full understanding of how Noth works, read the [Session Whitepaper](https://getsession.org/whitepaper).
